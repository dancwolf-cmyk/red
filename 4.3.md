## 4.3 Baselines

To contextualize the performance of the proposed Residual Expert Decomposition (RED), we compare it with several representative architectures that differ in modularity, routing mechanisms, and expert interaction. All baselines share the same backbone encoder to ensure comparability.

### 4.3.1 Global Head

This baseline attaches a single classification head to the backbone and trains it on the full dataset. It does not incorporate expert specialization or routing, and therefore represents a non-modular reference model for assessing the value of decomposition.

### 4.3.2 Per-Range Experts (Oracle Selection)

Five independent expert heads are trained, each on data restricted to a specific numerical interval. During evaluation, the correct expert is chosen using the true interval label:

$$
p(y \mid x) = \operatorname{softmax}(E_i(h(x))), \quad i = \mathrm{trueRange}(x).
$$

This configuration does not correspond to a deployable system, but provides an upper bound on the performance achievable when expert–range alignment is perfect.

### 4.3.3 Uniform Expert Averaging

This parameter-free ensemble aggregates predictions from all experts with equal weight:

$$
p(y \mid x) = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{i=1}^5 \operatorname{softmax}(E_i(h(x))).
$$

It evaluates whether modularization alone—without routing or residual refinement—provides benefits over a global model.

### 4.3.4 Softmax Gating (Classical MoE)

A gating network predicts mixture weights based on the backbone representation:

$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha}(x) = \operatorname{softmax}(W_r h_{\text{base}}(x)).
$$

The final prediction is a weighted combination of expert outputs:

$$
p(y \mid x) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \alpha_i(x)\, E_i(h(x)).
$$

This baseline represents a modular architecture without residual integration and serves as a direct comparison point for evaluating RED’s stability under routing variability.

The step-decomposed execution framework (Section 4.8) is not treated as a baseline because it evaluates execution capability under oracle structural information. Instead, it serves as an upper-bound diagnostic for assessing RED’s behavior when computational structure is externally supplied.
